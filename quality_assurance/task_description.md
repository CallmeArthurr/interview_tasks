You need to test basic operations of Singularity Map application (https://gridsingularity.com/singularity-map).  

There are 3 tasks to be completed: 
1. Write manual test cases for login and registration flow.
2. Try to find and report bugs with login and registration flow.
3. Write automated test suite for login and registration flow.

The automated test suite can be created either using Cypress or Selenium (ideally in Javascript or Python).

Extra points for writing the testcases in Gherkin syntax (given/when/then).
