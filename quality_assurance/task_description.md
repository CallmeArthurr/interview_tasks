Your assignment is to test basic operations of Grid Singularityâ€™s interface (Singularity Map): (https://gridsingularity.com/singularity-map).

There are 2 tasks to be completed: 
1. Try to find and report bugs with login and registration flow.
2. Write automated test suite for login flow.

The automated test suite can be created either using Cypress or Selenium (ideally in Javascript or Python).
Extra points for writing the testcases in Gherkin syntax (given/when/then) but not required.
